# Stack Overflow: How did it affect Software Development Collaboration?

As a student programmer, I discovered that [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) is the go-to websites for coding questions. Before Stack Overflow, it was difficult for developers to find reliable answers. They had to search through books, online forums or ask other developers. Stack Overflow has become a global knowledge with structured questions and answers that are publicly archived. It has changed the way people collaborate on coding problems. 

To illustrate this, I took a closer look at the thread ["Python execute playsound in separate thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53246933/python-execute-playsound-in-separate-thread). In this thread someone asks how to play a sound in Python inside the main method when a condition is true. As I faced the same issue myself in my Pygame project, I chose this thread the reflect on, as it felt relevant. 

## Quality Control
To make sure if an answers is correct and not just some educated guess there is an up- and downvote system, using an up-arrow and a down-arrow. Up means it's a useful answers, down means a not useful answer. 
In this thread the answer with the most upvotes is not the answer which the question asker marked as most useful. Both the up- and downvoting and marking most useful are relevant to quality control. 
Users get points for upvoted answers and lose points for downvoted ones. This shows other users who have more experience and who are more likely to provide a correct answer.

## Community Building
Stack Overflow has build a community based around problem solving. People don't just answer questions, they discuss, correct, and debate the best approach to a question. Upvoting, downvoting, reputation points and badges encourage people to contribute accordingly and provide helpful answers. This is meant to provide a feeling of community and teamwork. Someone takes the time and effort to take a look at your problem, come up with an answer and post the answer. Others take the time to improve an answer and determine the impact. This all ensures future visitors to benefit from the whole process

## Efficiency
When comparing Stack Overflow with the "old" methods, it has had a great impact on efficiency. Instead of spending hours or sometimes days on a (small) bug, An experienced programmer now spends much less time trying to fix a bug. However for a beginner, it can still take a long time, but still a lot less than they would have using the "old" methods. It speeds up the learning process which allows people to move on faster and learn even more. 

## My Reflection
Based on the thread and my own experience I do believe Stack Overflow has massively improved the way people collaborate within IT. Answer are found faster, solutions are shared more easily and everyone can join a discussion and contribute. 
Some downsides may be that it could take a while before a question gets answered and for beginners it can seem like there are a lot of rules and it could feel intense. 
All in all, for me, Stack Overflow is a huge help. And I'm glad it exists. However, it can be overwhelming, it's not easy to figure out where to start. For a beginner, it's not always that friendly. In my own experience, the answers given are not novice-based, they're often based on one-upping each other. This actually makes me less motivated to use Stack Overflow, even though I do value the need for Stack Overflow. I just prefer to spend endless hours trying to find other ways to come up with answers. Maybe that will change in the future.
